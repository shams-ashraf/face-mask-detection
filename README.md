#  Face Mask Detection using HOG, PCA, and SVM

This is a classical machine learning project for detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, using only traditional feature extraction and classification techniques â€” **no deep learning libraries** involved.

---

##  Techniques Used

- **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)**  
  Used to extract shape and edge-based features from grayscale facial images.

- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**  
  Reduces the dimensionality of the feature space for faster and more efficient classification.

- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**  
  Used for final classification. Linear and nonlinear kernels supported.

- **OpenCV**  
  For reading images and real-time video stream via webcam.
